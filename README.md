# Racket-md5

My own implementation of the md5 algorithm.

Based on the pseudocode found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Pseudocode) and other implementation found on [rosettacode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/MD5/Implementation) especiallly the python one (as i feel myself comfortable with it). To see a professional implementation in racket see [this](https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/fc194d73370407bf844b76ecd3c2f8e700805b40/racket/collects/file/md5.rkt).
